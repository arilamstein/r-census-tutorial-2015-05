This respository contains installation instructions and slides for my May 2015 tutorial [Analyzing US Census Data with R](http://www.meetup.com/R-ladies/events/222219319/).

Before attempting to run the code in the slides, please do the following:

1. Download the latest version of R. As of this writing, the latest 
version is 3.2.0. You can see your current version by typing `R.Version()` from the R command line.
You can get the latest version of R by googling "download latest version
of R".
